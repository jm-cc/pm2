		                POSIX compatibility


Marcel interface
================

The marcel_* interface is almost similar to the POSIX standard, except a few
notable exceptions:

- marcel_mutex_trylock() returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.
- marcel_attr_setstack() takes the stack _bottom_ as argument, not the stack
pointer.

and a bunch of semantic details that we considered as too expensive for a fast
thread library (different kinds of mutexes, ...)


PMarcel interface
=================

For a really POSIX compliant interface, please enable the "pmarcel" option in
the Marcel module. This will provide a pmarcel_* interface that exactly follows
the POSIX standard.

For saving the user the burden to rename all pthread_* calls into pmarcel
calls, a marcel/include/pthread/pthread.h file is provided that #defines_*
pthread_* into pmarcel_* .

Known limitations
-----------------

- some features will not be supported without quite some work:
  * process-shared mutexes and semaphores (spinlocks should work fine, however)
  * real-time signals
  * mutex(attr)_prioceiling/protocol
  * cond(attr)_set/getclock
  * complete SIGINFO for user-generated signals
 
PThread interface
=================

Marcel can provide an NPTL-ABI-compatible libpthread.so, hence saving the need
to recompile the target application. This is currently supported only on Linux.

For this, just chose the "libpthread" flavor and run make. For running some
application using Marcel's libpthread.so instead of the system's, run

pm2-libpthread yourapplication

That will set LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables
appropriately.

Known limitations
-----------------

The same as PMarcel, plus

- A 2.6 linux kernel is needed.
