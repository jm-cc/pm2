In order to use the "bubblelib" module, you need the following libraries and
their -dev or -devel part:

- libnuma (for Marcel's NUMA option)
- libming
- libfxt (available on cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/fkt co FxT )

You also need to configure your flavor:

- enable the bubblelib module (of course)
- enable the profile module
- enable the NUMA and profile options in the Marcel module

You can also just use the marcel-bubbles sample flavor.
