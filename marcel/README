0 . Requirements ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To be compiled, PM2 software needs:

* GNU Make >= 3.81
* GCC >= 3.3 (older versions may work but are no longer supported)
* GNU Bash (shells such as zsh or ksh may work but are untested)
* Perl
* GNU Autoconf > 2.50 when using NewMadeleine and/or puk.

* hwloc (when enabling MaMI or Marcel NUMA options)
* tbx


TO BE COMPLETED


1 . Installing hwloc

Sources for hwloc can be obtained either as a tarball at the
following address:

http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/

or from the Subversion server:

$ svn checkout http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/hwloc/trunk hwloc

Follow the provided instructions to install the library.


2 . Installing Tbx

Sources for tbx can be obtained from the Subversion server:
$ svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/pm2/trunk/tbx

Build the toolbox library and install it:
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/somewhere [--enable-hwloc] && make && make install
If you plan to use hwloc, do not forget to build tbx with hwloc support.

Configure your environment to enable pkgconfig tbx support:
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/somewhere/lib/pkgconfig


3 . Build Marcel

You can tune your marcel library, you should see options in ./configure --help

Build the library and install it:
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/somewhere && make && make install

You can run the test suite:
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/somewhere && make check


4 . Use Marcel

You need to use the wrapper script named marcel-exec to do every stuff that Marcel needs
(LD_PRELOAD when Marcel provides pthread interface and LD_BIND_NOW when topo=smp|numa is selected)
This script is installed with the library in /somewhere/bin

If you use an external thread-safe allocator which is optimized to your need, you must set the
environment variable MARCEL_ALLOCATOR_NOCHECK or build with --disable-allocator_check.
