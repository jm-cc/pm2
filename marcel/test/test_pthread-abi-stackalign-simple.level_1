# Tell `pm2-test' to preload things in the right order.  Supposedly,
# PukABI's directory is in libpthread's `RPATH' so the loader should
# be able to find it even if we don't specify its full path.
# Futhermore, we avoid specifying its full path to make sure the
# loader applies the same search rules to find `libPukABI.so' as a
# preloaded DSO *and* as a dependency of `libpthread.so', otherwise it
# could end up loading two different copies of `libPukABI.so'.
