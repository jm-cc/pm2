<SUBSECTION TITLE="Getting Access to the Source Code">

<P>
<MACRO NAME="madmpi"/> files are hosted by the project PM2 on the
InriaGforge at <URL>https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/pm2/</URL>.

The source code is managed by a <TT>Subversion</TT> server hosted by
the InriaGforge. To get the source code, you need:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
To install the client side of the software <TT>Subversion</TT> if it
is not already available on your system. The software can be obtained
from <URL>http://subversion.tigris.org/</URL>.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
To become a member of the project <TT>pm2</TT>. For this, you first
need to get an account to the gForge server. You can then become a
member of the project by contacting one of the project administrators.
The list of the project administrators is available from the main
project page.
</P>
<P>
You can also choose to check out the project's SVN repository through
anonymous access. In this case, you do not need to become a member,
and you will have limited access to the repository.

<P>
More information on how to get a gForge account, to become a member of
the specified project, or on any other related task can be obtained

<SUBSECTION TITLE="Network Protocols" LABEL="networkProtocols">

<P>
<B>
This section can be ignored if you plan to use the TCP protocol
only.
</B>
</P>

<P>
By default, the flavor for Mad-MPI only enables the TCP network
protocol. To enable more protocols such as MX or Quadrics, you need
to modify the flavor. This can be done easily by starting the tool
<TT>ezflavor</TT>. 
</P>

<CODE FILE="./code/ezflavor.txt"/>

<P>
Once the graphical interface <TT>ezflavor</TT> is started, click on
drop-down menu in the <TT>Flavors</TT> panel, select the flavor
<TT>nmad-mpi</TT> and click on the <TT>Load</TT> button in the same
panel.
</P>

<P>
The flavor is now loaded and can be modified. You can see in the
right-hand side panel <TT>Modules</TT> all the modules involved in
the implementation of Mad-MPI as well as all the options selected for
these modules.
</P>

<P>
In the <TT>Modules</TT> panel, select the <TT>nmad</TT> tab, the
options for this module will show up in the underneath panel. By using
the scrollbar on the right-hand side of this panel, you can scroll
down to the section showing the network protocols. Select the ones
which are available to you.
</P>

<P>
Click on the <TT>Save</TT> button in the <TT>Flavors</TT> panel to
record your modifications. You can now quit <TT>ezflavor</TT> by
pressing <TT>Ctrl-Q</TT>, or by selecting in the toolbar menu,
<TT>Flavor</TT>, and <TT>Quit</TT>.
