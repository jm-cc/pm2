Test loader configuration
-------------------------

make check does not run tests directly. There is a small program (source is test_loader.c)
which runs each test 8 times per default and kills the test 250 seconds later (deadlock check).

You can tune this behavious by setting the following environment variables:
- MARCEL_TEST_ITER
- MARCEL_TEST_TIMEOUT: time in seconds
