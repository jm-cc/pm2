Before starting building MARCEL, set the MARCEL_ROOT environment
variable.  For example, if you have installed MARCEL in your home
directory, out the following definitions (if under csh) in your .cshrc
file:

		setenv MARCEL_ROOT ${HOME}/marcel

Then, add the ${MARCEL_ROOT}/bin entry in your PATH environment
variable.

for example (under csh):

		setenv PATH ${PATH}:${MARCEL_ROOT}/bin

To build example programs, type aimk <file_name>. The file
<file_name>.c will be compiled and the exec file <file_name> will be
put in the directory corresponding to the underlying architecture
(e.g: ALPHA, LINUX, SUN4SOL2, etc.).

The file marcel/ARCHITECTURES contains the list of supported architectures.

Note that the GCC compiler is required for compiling MARCEL.
