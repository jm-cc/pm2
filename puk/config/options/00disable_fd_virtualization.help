Disable PukABI's file descriptor virtualization mechanism (recommended
if this feature is not needed).  By default, PukABI virtualizes file
descriptors by mapping OS-provided file descriptors to potentially
different integer values, allowing the use of unused integer values to
implement pseudo-file descriptors at the application level.
