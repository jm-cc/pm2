<ABSTRACT>
<P>
  Mad-MPI is a light implementation of the MPI standard. This simple,
  straightforward proof-of-concept implementation is a subset of the
  MPI API, that allows MPI applications to benefit from the NewMadeleine
  communication engine. Mad-MPI is based on the point-to-point
  nonblocking posting (<TT>isend</TT>, <TT>irecv</TT>) and completion
  (<TT>wait</TT>, <TT>test</TT>) operations of MPI, these four
  operations being directly mapped to the equivalent operations of
  NewMadeleine.
</P>
<P>
  Mad-MPI also implements some optimizations mechanisms for derived
  datatypes. MPI derived datatypes deal with noncontiguous memory
  locations. The advanced optimizations of NewMadeleine allowing to
  reorder packets lead to a significant gain when sending and
  receiving data based on derived datatypes.
