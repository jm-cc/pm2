A couple of things needs care for proper scalability:

- looking at the whole list of VPs can be a very expensive operation. With 100s
of cores, that's already several thousands of ns just to browse the list.
  That includes
  - ma_for_all_lwp
  - ma_for_each_lwp (adds yet one more read).
  - the (default!) MARCEL_SCHED_SHARED policy
  - ...

TODO: try_to_resched is still using ma_for_all_lwp...
