 * \param _EvDefTrId2Id
 *        It is a hashtable to find quickly a match for

 *        This hashtable is specific to each trace.

 * \param _FTypeStr2Code
 *        It is an hashtable to find quickly a match for the keyword
 *        describing a field type. This hashtable describe only the
 *        string allowed and can't be extended. This list is static,
 *        we initialize it only once for all traces. And the seond
 *        term of each pair is a unique code based on one binary
 *        digit.
 *
 * \param _FNameStr2Id
 *        It is an hashtable to find quickly a match for
 *        the keyword naming a definition's field. This hashtable
 *        can be complete by some new field added in the trace
 *        file. The second term of each pair is the id of the Name in
 *        the vector _FieldNames.
