Files in this directory are included in the Makefile of exemple or modules
of PM2

Here is a quick description of each file:
config.mak:
  * global option configuration file.
  * Included by common-vars.mak
common-vars.mak:
  * variables used everywhere.
  * Include config.mak
  * Included by objs-vars.mak and the main PM2 Makefile
common-rules.mak:
  * rules used everywhere.
  * Included by objs-vars.mak and the main PM2 Makefile
objs-vars.mak:
  * variables definitions for sources compilation
  * Include common-vars
  * Included by {apps,progs,libs}-vars.mak
objs-rules.mak:
  * rules descriptions for sources compilation
  * Include common-rules
  * Included by {apps,progs,libs}-rules.mak
apps.mak:
  * used for application (examples).
  * Include the two next one.
apps-vars.mak:
  * variables definitions
  * Include objs-vars
apps-rules.mak:
  * rules descriptions
  * Include objs-rules
libs.mak:
  * used for module generation.
  * Include the two next one.
libs-vars.mak:
  * variables definitions
  * Include objs-vars
libs-rules.mak:
  * rules descriptions
  * Include objs-rules
progs.mak:
  * used for progs generation (leonie, swann, ezflavor).
  * Include the two next one.
progs-vars.mak:
  * variables definitions
progs-rules.mak:
  * rules descriptions

In addition, {module}-config.mak are generated for each modules/application and
for each flavor if they do not exist (else they are included). They define
variables that are flavor dependant.
Theses files are stored in the flavor build directory


How to write a module Makefile ?
================================
It is quite simple: see modules/marcel/Makefile for example.

You have to define LIBRARY: the name of the module (mad3 for mad3)
You can define LIBNAME if different of the previvous: the name of the
library generated (mad for mad3)
You can define $(LIBRARY)_CC and/or $(LIBRARY)_AS (default CC and AS defined
in config.mak)

You include $(PM2_ROOT)/make/libs.mak

If you have more complexe things to do, you can refere to the Makefile of pm2
and mad3.

How to write a examples Makefile ?
==================================
You can define a FLAVOR_DEFAULT
You have to define PROGS (the list of progs to build)
You include $(PM2_ROOT)/make/apps.mak

You can define special rules for the building when APP_RECURSIF is defined.
Do not forget the extention in files' name.

See modules/marcel/examples/Makefile for example.
