I . Configuring MADELEINE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before starting building MADELEINE, set the MAD1_ROOT environment
variable.  For example, if you have installed MADELEINE in your home
directory, type the following line (if under csh) :

		setenv MAD1_ROOT ${HOME}/madeleine

Then, add the ${MAD1_ROOT}/bin entry in your PATH environment
variable.

for example (under csh):

		setenv PATH ${PATH}:${MAD1_ROOT}/bin


II . Building examples programs ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To build some examples programs, first choose the underlying
communication package you want to use. For instance, if you want to
build a TCP-sockets based implementation, just type:

		madcustom tcp

If you want to use PVM library (in this case, make sure you have set
the PVM_ROOT variable), type:

		madcustom pvm

Please have a look into the $MAD1_ROOT/make/ directory to see
which communication packages are currently supported.

Once you made your choice, go into the $MAD1_ROOT/examples
subdirectory and type:

		make

This will build some executable files and place them into the
./bin/`pvmgetarch` architecture (`pvmgetarch` will return either ALPHA
or LINUX or SUN4SOL2, etc.).

Note that the GCC compiler is required for compiling MADELEINE.


III . Running examples programs ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To run a MADELEINE application, you first have give the list of machines
that will belong to your "configuration". For instance, if you want to
use three machines named riri, fifi and loulou, just type:

		madconf riri fifi loulou

Note that some machines may have multiple network interfaces (for
instance both an Ethernet and a Myrinet interface). In that case, it
could be important to precise the name corresponding to the interface
you want to use. For instance, you can type:

		madconf riri-t fifi-t loulou-t

to use the Myrinet network if <host>-t describe the Myrinet interface
of the <host> machine.

Once your configuration registered, you're able to run a MADELEINE
application (say ./bin/LINUX/simple) by using the `madload'
loader:

		madload bin/LINUX/simple
