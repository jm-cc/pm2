This directory contains tarballs of Linux sysfs hierarchies collected on
various machines.  Each tarball also contain a file named `output',
which gives the expected output of "read-topology -v" for that machine.

Together with the `--marcel-topology-fsys-root' command-line option,
these are used by `test-topologies.sh' to check for any regression
introduced in Marcel's topology detection logic.
