On exit, mpirun returns a status of zero unless mpirun detected a problem, in
which case it returns a non-zero status.

Environment variables:
   - NMAD_DRIVER specifies the network driver to use. By default, the 
     driver selected by nmad-driver-conf is used.
   - NMAD_STRATEGY specifies the scheduler strategy to be used. By
     default, the strategy selected with nmad-strategy-conf is used.
