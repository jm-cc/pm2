/** \file
 * \brief Bubble Gang scheduler
 * \defgroup marcel_bubble_gang Bubble Gang scheduler
 *
 * Gang Scheduling was proposed back in the 1980's by Ousterhout for
 * efficiently exploiting machines by taking affinities into account.  The idea
 * is to schedule together the threads of the same "gang".
 *
 * This is here realized by expressing gangs thanks to bubbles: a bubble just
 * holds the threads of a gang, and a daemon thread is spawned for actually
 * performing the scheduling.
 *
 * The daemon thread takes a bubble from the ::ma_gang_rq runqueue, puts it on
 * a scheduling runqueue, and leave it there for some time during which the
 * basic Self-Scheduler can schedule the threads of the bubble. The daemon
 * thread then puts the bubble back into ::ma_gang_rq, and loops with another
 * bubble.
 *
 * If (for instance), the gangs are not big enough for filling the whole
 * machine, it is possible to start several concurrent bubble gang schedulers
 * by just spawning several daemon threads.

/** \brief Gang scheduler thread function
 *
 * This is the "thread function" for gang scheduling.
 *
 * \param runqueue is the runqueue on which the gang scheduler will put bubbles
 * to be scheduled.
 *
 * You may for instance use
 * \code
 * marcel_create(NULL, NULL, marcel_gang_scheduler, &marcel_topo_levels[0][0].sched);
 * \endcode
 * to spawn one Gang scheduler which will put bubbles for the whole machine,
 * or use
 * \code
 * marcel_create(NULL, NULL, marcel_gang_scheduler, &marcel_topo_levels[1][0].sched);
 * marcel_create(NULL, NULL, marcel_gang_scheduler, &marcel_topo_levels[1][1].sched);
 * \endcode
 * to spawn two Gang schedulers which will put bubbles for one part of the
 * machine each, etc.
 *
 * You should probably use
 * \code 
 * marcel_attr_setprio(&attr, MA_SYS_RT_PRIO);
 * \endcode
 * for making sure that the Gang Scheduler can preempt other threads.
